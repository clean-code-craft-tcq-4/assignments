Low latency =10second

Book ticket online with latency less than 40ms

Number of tickets being booked should not affect the latency

Ensure test environment has optimal network speed with at-least 40Mbps. Book the ticket and await for response. Should be less than...

**Operation profile**: Capture the number of users online and calculate the latency and show that while ticket booking.Also add a suggested timing based on analysis of data for one week.

Total time taken by payment gateway should be less than 30 seconds

User should be able save half filled information and resume booking later.

## I need the embedded software in a public car charger to be reliable = User need

let the charger restart every 3 days once as the traffic rates are increasing
test the 4th day (i.e once it is restarted) just to make sure, all the developed features are working as expected

Use the charger for 10 hours. 2. Verify if it lasts for 10 hours 3. Check discharge rate to verify if is in range

switch on the public charger and check if it is working for 10hrs .check every 10hrs if the system is getting reset.

The Charger should be tested in varying environments such as under low , high temperature, Rain ,etc as agreed with the User.

## I need to collect data from an IoT temperature sensor to monitor batteries

Provide consistent charge rate w.r.to charger capacity

Temperature sensor Accuracy & Precision must be +/- 0.4°C. 

Temperature sensor Measurement Range should be -50°C — 150°C.

Temperature sensor sampling rate should be every 1 minute.

 out of 100 samples actual and expected temperature from sensor must be equal for at least 98 samples. 

 Verify that temperature value is precise to a 10-bit. And its value is +/-2% accurate.
